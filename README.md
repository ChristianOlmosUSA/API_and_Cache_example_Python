# The English Dictionary Terminal App


The [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) is an amazing resource for english language lovers; It features the accurate definitions of words, not like other services like Wikipedia, Oxford, etc.

in this project your are going to build a terminal based (CLI) dictionary.

### Before you begin

1. Register a [RapidAPI.com](https://rapidapi.com/) account and make your to request a key for the [urban dictionary API](https://rapidapi.com/community/api/urban-dictionary).
2. Watch this 15 min video to [understand pipenv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qmnh5C4Pmo), the python package manager.

### Running the boilerplate

The boilerplate comes with pipenv installed (the python package manager):

Install the application dependencies by typing (only once):

```bash
$ pipenv install
```
Run the application by typing (every time):

```bash
$ pipenv run python app.py
```

### üìù Features that the application must have

1. Greet the user
2. Ask the user for the term he/she wants to look up, use the `input("What term do you want to look for?")` python function.
3. Use the python requests package to code your GET request to the Urban Dictionary API
4. Process the response body, understand it and get the word definition from the incoming response body.
5. Show the definition on the terminal.
6. Store the definition in a JSON file.

### üçæ Aditional PERKS

1. Cache system: If the user asks for the same word again, instead of calling the API again you should have the previous reposnes stored in a `dict`.
2. Use `sys.argv` to allow the user to ask for a definition like this:

```python
# "enjoy" is the word the user is looking up the definition
$ pipenv run python app.py enjoy
```

Hint: [how to use the sys.argv](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/system/python-sys-argv)

3. Look for multiple words separated by comma.
